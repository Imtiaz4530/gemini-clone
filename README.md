# Gemini clone - AI-Powered Chatbot

This project is a **Gemini clone** that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to provide intelligent, conversational AI. Built using **Gemini API** , this application allows users to interact with AI for a variety of use cases such as casual conversation, problem-solving, and creative writing.

- **Customizable AI Models**: Allows easy integration with different language models for specialized tasks

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **AI API**: GEMINI

## üñºÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users type their queries or prompts into the chat interface.
2. **AI Processing**: The text is sent to the backend where the **GEMINI model** processes the input.
3. **AI Response**: The AI generates a response based on the model's understanding of the query.
4. **Output**: The response is displayed to the user in real-time on the frontend interface.
